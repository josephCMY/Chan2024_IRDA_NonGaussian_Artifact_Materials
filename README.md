## Description
This repository contains the following materials for Chan's original research article manuscript ("Improving Infrared Radiance Ensemble Data Assimilation though Mitigating Deleterious Non-Gaussian Artifacts")
1) `DART_modified`: A modified version of the NCAR Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART)
2) `WRF_v4.5.1`: Weather Research and Forecast model version 4.5.1
3) `Expt_Performance_Diagnostics`: Files containing the performance diagnostics used to generate the figures in the manuscript
4) `Plot_Diagnostics`: Some of the Python scripts used to generate the figures in the manuscript.

Due to the sheer volume of raw simulation data produced in this study (~11 terabytes), raw simulation data is not archived on this repository.
