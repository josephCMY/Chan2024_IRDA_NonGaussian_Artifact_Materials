COAMPS Nest
===========

.. attention::

   ``COAMPS_NEST`` works with versions of DART *before* Manhattan (9.x.x) and has yet to be updated. If you are interested in
   using ``COAMPS_NEST`` with more recent versions of DART, contact DAReS staff to assess the feasibility of an update.
   Until that time, you should consider this documentation as out-of-date.


Overview
--------

An updated version of the COAMPS model interfaces and scripts.

This interface was contributed by Alex Reinecke of the Naval Research
Lab-Monterey.

The primary differences from the original COAMPS model code are:

- the ability to assimilate nested domains
- assimilates real observations
- a simplified way to specify the state vector
- I/O COAMPS data files
- extensive script updates to accommodate additional HPC environments
