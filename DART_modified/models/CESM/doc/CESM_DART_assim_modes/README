These files are not used by the documentation, but renamed copies of them are
(see the list of definitions at the end of ../../readme.rst)

These files were created by the following.
1) Generate the pictures in Powerpoint.
2) Export the file as .png, which created this directory
   and put each slide into a separate file; Slide1.png, ....
3) on a Mac: 
   a) 'open' each Slide#.png, 
   b) take a screen shot of the useful part of the image
   c) rename the result with a useful name, like CAM-only.png
4) Put the pathname of that file into $dart/models/CESM/doc/setup_guidelines.html
