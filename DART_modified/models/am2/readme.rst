AM2
===

.. attention::

   ``AM2`` works with versions of DART *before* Manhattan (9.x.x) and has yet to be updated. If you are interested in
   using ``AM2`` with more recent versions of DART, contact DAReS staff to assess the feasibility of an update.
   Until that time, you should consider this documentation as out-of-date.


Overview

AM2 is an atmospheric model developed as part of a coupled atmosphere-ocean
general circulation system developed at NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics
Laboratory.

If you are interested in running DART with this model please contact the DART
